Cheese is a type of dairy product produced in a range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk (usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats or sheep). During production, milk is usually acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese. Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout.

Most cheeses mature for several months to several years.
Cheese is valued for its portability, long life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk. Cheese is also used as an ingredient in many other foods, such as pizza, macaroni dishes, casseroles, sauces, and baked dishes.
Cheese is a staple food in many cultures around the world, including Western culture, and plays a significant role in many national cuisines. Cheese is valued for its
